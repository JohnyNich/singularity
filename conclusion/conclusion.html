            <li>AI could help speed up jobs that we don't wan</li>
            <li>Encryption means that important information can be kept secret</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Bad:</p>
        <ul id="bad">
        	<li>Encryption means that terroist groups can send information and messages about plans without anyone knowing.</li>
            <li>The NSA, HMSS, and other goverment organizations can spy on you using your phone, your computer or pretty much anything technological</li>
            <li>AIs could become smarter than humans (This is known as the singularity, and this is incredibly hypothetical).</li>
        </ul>
