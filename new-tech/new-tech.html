        <h3>3D Printing</h3>
        <p>3D Printing is the process of using a machine, known as a 3D printer, to "print" a 3D using a material known as filament. 3D Printers usually use software for the user to input their design and then the will print it.</p>
        <p>There are 4 main types of 3D Printers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>FDM (Fused Deposition Modelling) - This is the most common type of 3D Printing, where the filament is heated up and then extruded using a nosel onto the work plate. The nozzle moves left. right, forward and backward and the work plate moves up and down.</li>
        </ul>
