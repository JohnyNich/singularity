        <h3>3D Printing</h3>
        <p>3D Printing is the process of using a machine, known as a 3D printer, to "print" a 3D using a material known as filament. 3D Printers usually use software for the user to input their design and then the will print it.</p>
        <p>There are 4 main types of 3D Printers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>FDM (Fused Deposition Modelling) - This is the most common type of 3D Printing, where the filament is heated up and then extruded using a nosel onto the work plate. The nozzle moves left. right, forward and backward and the work plate moves up and down.</li>
            <li>SLA (Steriolithography) - This a more advanced and more expensive type of 3D Printing, where a laser hardens the resin in a resin bath</li>
            <li>SLS (Selective Laser Sintering) - This is a more rare form of 3D Printing. SLS printers use a laser to join a bed of powder together to create an object.
            <li>5-axis - This is the most expensive and rare form of CAM (Computer Aided Manufacutring). 5-axis machines uses a cutting tool to cut a block of material until it is the desired shape. It's not usally considered as a 3D Printer as it doesn't use a filament or a powder, and it cuts of material instead of creating it.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Applications of 3D Printing</h3>
        <p>3D Printing has a number of applications including:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Mass manufacturing - You can make a large batcch of a product efforlessly in a short amount of time.</li>
        	<li>Mass customization - It's easy for the user/client to customize a product, as a 3D Design can be altered in a small space of time. An example is engraving.</li>
        	<li>Rapid prototyping - You can easily print a prototype without having to make it, so you can test a prototype more thoroughly before creating the final product.</li>
        	<li>Prostetic body parts - You can easily 3D print a body part anywhere in the world and with incredible detail, as long as you have a 3D printer.</li>
        	<li>Bio printing - Creating body parts like body tissue and bones and even hearts</li>
        	<li>Pills - 3D printing pills could mean that pharmacies could become smaller.</li>
        	<li>Art and Jewelry - Creating art and jewelry are extremely simple compared to most of these examples. All you need to do is supply the right material as filament and then you would get a custom-made piece of artwork or jewelry.</li>
        	<li>Cars - The outer body of a car and some of the parts of the car can be replaced with 3D printed parts, which would mean replacing parts would become much easier. The Audi RSQ is an example of a car which was mass manufactured using CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing), where they used KUKA robots to rapidly prototyping a car.</li>
        	<li>Construction and Architecture - 3D printers can help to prototype buildings and even create whole buildings</li>
        	<li>Firearms - 3D printers have caused controversy when some people had 3D printed firearms which can work. This could cause an increase crime rate (or decrease it, depending on your views).</li>
        	<li>Computers - 3D printers can be used to create laptop cases and even possibly computers in the future.</li>
        	<li>Space - 3D printers can be used to create resources and machines in space. It can also be used to create space vehichles and parts for space vehicles.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence is a concept which is creating a machine or piece of code which can learn and develop without the need of a human.  They can also use provided input and decide on an output using algorithms. There are many sci-fi depictions of artificial intelligence, sometimes abbreviated as AI, like Hal-9000, The Terminator, Ultron, which use the concept of AIs which are conscious and can have their own thoughts. This form of AI is very far off if not impossible. </p>
        <h3>Applications of Artificial Intelligence</h3>
        <p>Some applications of artificial intelligence could include:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Computer Science - Making AI overcome hard challenges for software engineers and sometiems just helping and lessening the workload.</li>
        	<li>Education - AI robots could be used to teach children, or assist in teaching children.</li>
        	<li>Medicine - AIs could perform surgery, diagnose patients, and do other medical jobs around a hosptial.</li>
        	<li>Manufacturing - Robotos, usally not AI but possibly in the future, are being used with manufacturing and humans and sweat shops.</li>
        	<li>Saftey - AI robots could be used to do jobs which aren't safe for humans, like maintaining a nuclear power plant, acessing volcanos, or maintaining cities with a half life (cities which are contaminated by radiation) like Chernobyl.</li>
        	<li>Transportation - AI could be driving our cars and busses. Two big companies which you have probally heard about using AI for cars are Google, who are creating a concept car known as the Google Car, and Tesla, who have a service on most Tesla veichles known as Autopilot</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Google AI experiments</h3>
        <p>Google AI experiments is a website from google which allows you to try out cool AI experiments which show the capabilites of artificial intellegence.</p>
