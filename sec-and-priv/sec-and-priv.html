		<h3>What is encryption</h3>
		<p>Encryption is the process of creating a sequence of numbers and/or letters which can be interpreted as text. For example, if each letter was a number, A being 1, B being 2, etc, Bob would be encrypted into 2-15-2. The pattern which is followed, which in this case was A is 1, B is 2, etc, is known as the key.</p>
		<p>There are two main types of encryption: <span class="special-word">Symmetric key algorithms</span> and <span class="special-word">Asymmetric key algorithms</span></p>
		<h3>Symmetric key algorithms</h4>
		<p>Imagine if a man, named Bob, had a box, a padlock and two keys which can both open the padlock. Say Bob wanted to send a message to his friend, Alice, via normal mail. He would give one key to her and keep one for himself. First, he'd put the message in the box and lock it with the padlock, using the key he has. Then, he sent it using normal mail to Alice. When Alice received it, she can use her key to open it. This is called <span class="special-word">ymmetric key algorithms</span>. This is a type of encryption in which both the sender and the receiver have the key, which is known in encryption terms as, well, a key. This "key" is the algorithm which encrypts the message and, usally, the encryption pattern can be reversed to decrypt it.</p>
		<h3>Aysmmetric key algorithms</h3>
		<p>The problem with symmetric key algorithms is that if someone, say a corrupt postman, got acsess to the key, he could steal the message. The way around this is <span class="special-word">assymetric key algorithms</span>, sometimes known as RSA algoritjms or assymetric cryptography algorithms. Imagine if Bob had a message he wanted to send to Alice. Instead of sending her a key, he sends her a padlock, the key to the padlock he has. Alice then puts a message inside the box and locks it with the padlock and sends it via normal mail. Bob wil then open it with his key and read the contents. In computing, this "padlock" is known as a <span class="special-word">public key</span>. This public key can be put online and shared with anyone, but with it, the message can't be decrypted nor reverse enginnered. The only way to decrypt the message is using the key that only the receiver (who, in the above instance, would be Bob), known as the <span class="special-word">private key</span>. This way, if any sneaky postman or hackers get hold of the message, they won't be able to read or decrypt the message.</p>

		<h3>Edward Snowden</h3>
		<img src="../assets/edward-snowden.jpg" id="edward-snowden"/>
		<p>Edward Joseph Snowden was born on June the 21st, 1983 in Elizabeth City, North Carolina and later moved to Maryland. He studied computing at Maryland community colledge before joining the US Army in 2003, only to be discharged after breaking both legs in a training accident. His first job was as a security guard for one of the NSA's (National Security Agentcy) secret facilites at the University of Maryland. He then worked for IT Security at the CIA (Central Intellegence Agency). Then, in 2007, he was given a CIA post with diplomatic cover (he could do things without being affected by the law) in Geneva. He left the CIA in 2009 to rejoin the NSA, doing contract work.</p>
		<p>In May 2013, he left his contract job at Booz Allen in Hawai and came to Hong Kong, where he leaked NSA documents to journalist Glenn Greenwald. These documents revealed detailed secret NSA programmes and capabilites which were and continue to be used to collect and store personal communications data in and outside of the US.</p>
		<P>These docuemnts contained information on how the US and other countries, like the UK and Germany, collected masses of citizen data, without a warrant. It also detalis how the NSA and it's partners have carried out numerous industrial and policical espionages, most of which were not tod o with counterterroism purpoues, including the bugging of the EU and UN buildings and the collection of phone and email data from Brazil's Ministry of Mines and Energy. Because Snowden released these documents, he is, if returned to the US, accountable for up to 30 years in prison.</P>
		<p>Currently, Snowden resides in Russia, in asylum, and out of the jurisdiction of the US. Yet, the US is trying to have Russia hand Snowden over to the US, so he can be charged and jailed.</p>
		<h3>The Apple-FBI San Bernardino Encryption dispute</h3>
		<img src="../assets/apple.png" id="apple"/>
		<img src="../assets/fbi.png" id="fbi"/>
		<p>In December 2015, a terroist attack killing 14 and seriously injuring 22 occured. The FBI recovered an iPhone 5c which was owned by one of the shooters and was thought to contain more information on the attack and possibly information on upcoming attacks. The shooter's phone was locked with a 4-digit passcode.</p>
		<p>The FBI were unable to unlock the phone nor recover any information from it. The FBI then asked the NSA (National Security Agency) to hack into the phone, yet they couldn't as they only had the knowledge to hack into usual criminal devices and not civiilian products, like iPhones. The FBI then asked Apple to update their operating system, iOS, so that the FBI could have a "backdoor" into this phone and, consequently, every iPhone which had the new software installed onto it.</p>
		<p>Apple denied the requests as it's policy and "moral code" is to never undermine the security of their customer's products. Apple also worried that, if the technology got into the wrong hands, the user could hack into any iPhone efforlessly. Apple also worried that the FBI would use it multiple times, and the more they used it, the less important a case would have to be for them to use the backdoor, where it gets to the point where a simple robbery. The FBI then issued a federal court order, which Apple also denied. There was then a period of tension between Apple and the FBI. But then, on March the 21st, the goverment announced that a third party was said to have information to unlock the phone. The third party succeeded in opening the phone and the case was closed.</p>
