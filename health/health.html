		<h3>What is blue light</h3>
		<p>Blue light is the light emmited from your phones, televions, computers, and most other electrical devices which throws off your body clock, known as your circadian rhythm, which means your body can't decide on it's own whether it's day or night. This affects your sleeping and can sometimes lead to getting less sleep or finding it harder to sleep, which can lead to diabetes, depression and cardiovascular problems. Even dim light can have an effect on your sleeping. A mere 8 lux (the light emmited by most desk lamps and twice the light emmited by night lights) can have effects on your circadian rhythm.</p>
		<h3>The effects of blue light</h3>
		<p>Blue light has been shown to be a contributer in cancer. This is because light stops the production of melatonin, a hormone that influences our circadian rhytms and some experimental research has been shown to link low melatonin levels to cancer, but note that this research is still in early days.</p>
		<p>Exposure to blue light increases the suppression of melatonin more powerfully. Harvard conducted an experiment comparing 6.5 hours of exposure to blue light to 6.5 hours of exposure to green light. Exposure to blue light shifted the subjectsâ€™ circadian rhythm by 3 hours while green light shifted it by only 1.5 hours.</p>
		<p>A Harvard study was conducted to see how diabetes and obesity was linked to your circadian rhythms. They put 10 people on a sleeping schedule and gradually increased their circadian rhythms. When people's circadian levels increased (when they stayed up longer), blood sugar levels increased and levels of leptin, a hormone which makes you feel full after a meal, went down, making the subjects feel more hungry.</p>
		<p>On the other hand, it is beneficial in the day, as it boosts attention, reaction time and mood during the day.</p>
		<p>If you are a night owl or night shift worker, it's advised that you wear eyewear that blocks blue light</p>
