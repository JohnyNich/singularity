		<h3>What is blue light</h3>
		<p>Blue light is the light emmited from your phones, televions, computers, and most other electrical devices which throws off your body clock, known as your circadian rhythm, which means your body can't decide on it's own whether it's day or night. This affects your sleeping and can sometimes lead to getting less sleep or finding it harder to sleep, which can lead to diabetes, depression and cardiovascular problems. Even dim light can have an effect on your sleeping. A mere 8 lux (the light emmited by most desk lamps and twice the light emmited by night lights) can have effects on your circadian rhythm.</p>
		<h3>The effects of blue light</h3>
		<p>Blue light has been shown to be a contributer in cancer. This is because light stops the production of melatonin, a hormone that influences our circadian rhytms and some experimental research has been shown to link low melatonin levels to cancer, but note that this research is still in early days.</p>
		<p>Exposure to blue light increases the suppression of melatonin more powerfully. Harvard conducted an experiment comparing 6.5 hours of exposure to blue light to 6.5 hours of exposure to green light. Exposure to blue light shifted the subjects’ circadian rhythm by 3 hours while green light shifted it by only 1.5 hours.</p>
		<p>A Harvard study was conducted to see how diabetes and obesity was linked to your circadian rhythms. They put 10 people on a sleeping schedule and gradually increased their circadian rhythms. When people's circadian levels increased (when they stayed up longer), blood sugar levels increased and levels of leptin, a hormone which makes you feel full after a meal, went down, making the subjects feel more hungry.</p>
		<p>On the other hand, it is beneficial in the day, as it boosts attention, reaction time and mood during the day.</p>
		<p>If you are a night owl or night shift worker, it's advised that you wear eyewear that blocks blue light</p>
		<h3>The bionic eye</h3>

		<p>Rhian Louis is a patient diagnosed with Retinitis Pigmentosa, a disease which damages the light detecting cells in the retina, her right eye is completely blind and her left is virtually without sight. She has had hardly any vision for around 8 years. There is no cure for the disease but a treatment being trialed in Oxford may have a method to give her sight back. The treatment was to replace the damaged cells with an electronic chip to give her some of her sight back.</p>
		<p>Once the chip has been implanted, the brain has to, in a sense, learn to see again, as it hasn’t have to see anything in the past 8 years. To do this, the brains will first learn to recognize flashes of light. Then, it will eventually expand untill it will almost function as a fully working eye.</p>
		<h3>Hearing colours</h3>

		<p>Neil Harbisson was born with a rare visual condition called achromatopsia, which is total color blindness, so everything he sees is in black and white. But in 2003, he started a project with computer scientist Adam Montandon and with help from Peter Keese and Matias Lizana, to create an “electronic eye”.</p>
		<p>This device uses a color sensor to detect the color frequency of a color and then sends the frequency to a chip installed in his head, which plays the sound using bone conduction.</p>
		<p>When he first got the electronic eye, he would have to memorize the notes/frequencies of each colour. Then, the noticing became seamless. Then, he began to develop favourites and even dream in colour. Neil has also created music based off people’s voices, he’s created artwork based off music and even artwork based of speeches.</p>
		<p>He has adapted his “eye” so that he can hear ultraviolet and infrared. He has also started a company named the Cyborg foundation to help people to get cybernetic body parts.</p>
